- symetric/asymetric encryption
- digital signatures
- hash functions
- merkle tree / merkle patricia tree / verkle tree
- blockchain timeline:
    - pre-1970s symetric cryptography
    - 1970s asymetric cryptography: Diffie Helman Key Exchange ([ot](https://github.com/archit-p/simplest-oblivious-transfer))
    - 1980s David Chaum - Blind Signatures / Digicash
    - 1990s Adam Back - HashCash / [Wei Dai - B-Money](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt) / [Bit Gold - Nick Szabo](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/)
    - 2000s Peer to peer networks: Freenet / Gnutella / Bit Torrent
    - 2008 [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch08.asciidoc)
- blockchain components:
    - a p2p network (based on "gossip" protocol)
    - messages (txs) representing state transitions
    - consensus rules (determines valid state transitions)
    - a state machine that processes txs according to consensus
    - a chain of cryptographically secured blocks
    - a consensus algorithm to enforce the consensus rules
    - a game-theory incentive scheme
    - one or more open source software impementations of the above (clients)
- blockchain architecture:
    - network: all participants are equal (p2p), no "special" nodes, no server, no centralised service, no hierarchy
    - nodes:
        - accept and transmit txs
        - keep a mempool
        - provide network discovery (via DNS seed nodes / locally stored list) and routing functions
        - drop connections to misbehaving nodes
        - accept blocks and update local ledger
        - connections are based on proximity in a hash table, not on geographical proximity
    - block data structure: header, timestamp, parent hash, nonce, txs
    - storage data structures: organised in Merkle trees / Merkle Patricia trees
    - alternative data structures: DAG (Sui/IOTA)
    - modular blockchains: [deep dive](https://volt.capital/blog/modular-blockchains) / [blockspace](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/03/ethereum-blockspace-who-gets-what-and-why)
        - execution: smart contracts business logic impl. Can be moved away from the evm (Starknet)
        - settlement/consensus: agreement on state transitions. Is securing the updates to the execution layer
        - [data availability](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-availability/): where the data is stored and how to make sure it's available to the participants in the system
            - sampling (DAS): a way for the network to check that data is available. Each node (including non-staking ones) download small, randomly selected subset of data, gaining high confidence that all the data is available
            - committees (DACs): trusted parties that provide, or attest to, data availability. PoS DAC are more secure because they direclty incentivize honest behavior
- [ethereum consensus](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/)
    - Technically, proof-of-work and proof-of-stake are not consensus protocols by themselves, but they are often referred to as such for simplicity. They are actually Sybil resistance mechanisms and block author selectors; they are a way to decide who is the author of the latest block. It is this Sybil resistance mechanism combined with a chain selection rule that makes up a true consensus mechanism.
    - block addition has two parts: 
        - block producer selection
        - block acceptance
    - pre-merge:
        - Beacon Chain wasn't processing Mainnet transactions. Was only reaching consensus on its own state (active validators and their account balances - [specs](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs#phase-0)).
    - post-merge:
        - Eth 1.0 continue to handle execution (process blocks, maintain mempool, manage and sync state). PoW has been taken out
        - Beacon Chain continues to handle PoS consensus (track chain's head, gossip, attest blocks, receive validator rewards)
    - [execution clients](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#execution-clients)
    - [consensus clients](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#consensus-clients)
    - [client diversity](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/client-diversity/)
    - block finality: 
        - tendermint chains can halt if they don't get enough votes
        - nakamoto continue to add blocks and may not achieve finality
        - Ethereum achives finality by checkpointing (epochs every ~6min)

## [1.2. Why Scalability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIve3zX2xnw)
- Introduction:
    - regular users can run an eth node ([vitalik](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html))
    - Ethereum goal is to keep hardware requirements low ([scaling](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/))
    - blockchain performance is [hard to measure](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/why-blockchain-performance-is-hard-to-measure/) and TPS can have little real value

- Layer 1 solutions
    - eth validators form comittees and votes are aggregated by them
    - solana moved away from gossip protocol => only the leader (block producer) needs to receive txs so nodes send them to the leader not to the other nodes
    - eth txs are ordered and executed sequentially => simple design but leads to MEV / poor horizontal scaling
    - solana / aptos / sui allow parallel processing of  (non dependent) txs
    - sharding:
        - eth will have 64 shards
        - [introduction](https://medium.com/@icebearhww/ethereum-sharding-and-finality-65248951f649)
        - vitalik's [overview](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html) & [limits](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html)
    - rollups:
        - tx execution outside L1
        - data / proof of txs is on L1
        - rollup smart contract on L1 that can enforce correct tx execution on L2 by using the tx data from L1
        - L1 holds the funds; L2 holds state and performs execution
        - txs are commited to main chain in bundles (they are rolled-up)
        - are either optimistic or zk ([fraud proof vs. validity proof](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/validity-proof-vs-fraud-proof#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20validity%20proof,information%20shared%20between%20the%20two.))
        - validity / zk => operator sumbmits a new state transition AND a cryptographic proof (a zk-SNARK) that the new state is valid transition from the old state. The state transitions is validated by a smart contract on L1. Usually the zero knowledge is ignored and input/data involved is public.
        - optimistic => assumes that the nodes are behaving honestly. State transition can be rolled back by providing a "fraud proof". After a certain period the state transition is considered final on L1.
    - state channels: 2 txs on L1 | eth locked in a multisig contract | either party can exit/close the channel ([lightning network](https://lightning.network))
    - plasma chains ([eth docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/plasma) / [vitalik article](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/14/neoplasma.html)): utilize fraud proofs like optimistic rullups but have the mass exit problem.
    - Polygon [PoS](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/pos/) has a three-layer [architecture](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/pos/polygon-architecture/):
        - Ethereum layer â€” a set of contracts on the Ethereum mainnet.
        - [Heimdall](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/matic-system-overview-heimdall/8323) layer
        - [Bor](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/pos/design/bor/) layer
    - [Skale](https://skale.space)
    - [Loom](https://loomx.io)
- Ethereum Scalability directions:
    - The L2 scaling transition - [everyone moving to rollups](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698)
    - The wallet security transition - everyone moving to [smart contract wallets](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html)
    - The privacy transition - making sure privacy-preserving funds transfers are available

## [1.3. Intro to L2s / Maths and Cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIXFlD-2PGU)

- Bridges vs. L2
    - less functional and more specialized
    - atomic token transfers
    - lock and mint mechanism
    - quite widespread ([wormhole](https://wormhole.com/))

- [Optimistic rollups](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/) in details:
    - bundle multiple off-chain txs in batches => reduces fees for end users
    - use compression techniques
    - if unchallenged within the challange period => it's deemed valid and accepted on L1
    - others can continue to build on unconfirmed rollup block **BUT** txs results will be reversed if based on an incorrectly executed tx published previously
    - process:
        - dev sends tx off-chain to aggregator
        - aggregator = anyone with a bond => multiple aggregators on the same chain
        - aggregator decides how fees are paid (acc abstraction / meta-tx)
        - instant guarantee to dev that tx will be included in the block (or else aggregator loses their bond)
        - aggregator locally applies the tx & computes the new state root
        - aggregator sumbits a L1 tx (which contains the L2 tx & state root) and pays for gas (which contains tx & state root)
        - if block is found invalid => invalidity proved with `verify_state_transition(prev_state, block, witness)`:
            - slashes the malicious aggregator & any aggregator who built on top of the invaid block
            - rewards the prover with a portion of the prover's bond
- [types](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1527052511844212738.html) of fraud proof systems:
    - level 1: admin can upgrade the system within the challenge period
    - level 2: admin can upgrade the system within the challenge period, but is **permissioned** to allow a few others to run the fault proof
    - level 3: admin can upgrade the system within the challenge period, but fault proof is **permissionless**
    - level 4: admin can NOT upgrade the system until users have a chance to withdraw their funds
- tx compression:
    - L1 tx takes ~110 bytes. L2 tx takes ~12 bytes (due to superior encoding + other compression tricks)
- data availability
    - to recreate the state, tx data is needed
    - where is data stored and how it's available to participants in the system
- [StarkNet](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/):
    - ZK-Tollup mode (on-chain validity proofs)
    - state diff is sent as calldata to L1 => anyone can reconstruct the current state of StarkNet
    - to update the state on L1 it's enough to send a valid proof, without information on the txs or particular changes this update caused. => more info must be provided to allow other parties to locally track StarkNet's state
- [zkEVM](https://scroll.io/blog/zkEVM):
    - vm designed to emulate the EVM by recreating all existing EVM opcodes
    - acts as a state machine, processes state transitions of L2 txs
    - generates validity proofs that confirm the accuracy of the off-chain state change
    - two ways to build dApps on zk-Rollups:
        - app-specific circuit (ASIC):
            - very limited (R1CS only supports addition and multiplication). Circuit == program representation used in a zero knowledge proof 
            - unique circuits for each dapp => reduced overhead for dapps
            - needs high-level dev expertise in circuit design
        - universal EVM for smart contract execution
- [(Proto) Danksharding](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/proto_danksharding_faq#Proto-Danksharding-FAQ):
    - implements most of the logic and scaffolding for full Danksharding, but not yet implementing any sharding
    - the main feature is the introduction of a **blob-carrying transaction**, which is like a regular tx but it carries an extra piece of data called **blob**
        - blobs are extremely large (byte string up to ~125kB)
        - blobs are committed with [KZG commitment](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2020/06/16/kate-polynomial-commitments.html) scheme and are forward compatible with DAS
        - blobs are not accessible to the EVM and deleted after 1-3 months. The EVM can only view a commitment to the blob. Blobs are stored by the consensus layer (beacon chain)
        - blob is a vector of 4096 field elements, numbers within the range 0 <= x < 52435875175126190479447740508185965837690552500527637822603658699938581184513
    - currlently rollups post txs on L1 using CALLDATA (proccessed by all nodes and stored on-chain permanently)
    - once proto-danksharding is rolled out, execution layer, rollups and users need to do no further work to finish the transition to full sharding
    - the main practical difference between [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488) and [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844) is that EIP-4488 attempts to minimize the changes needed today, whereas proto-danksharding makes a larger number of changes today so that few changes are required in the future to upgrade to full sharding
    - leads to a maximum usage of ~1MB/block (~2.5TB/year)
    - consensus layer can implement separate logic to auto-delete blob data after some time (e.g 30 days) and not dependent of [EIP-4444](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4444) implementation
    - in the long run  full sharding will add ~40 TB of historical data per year => some history expiry mechanism is mandatory
    - historical data will be stored by rollups, block explorers, hobbyinsts, indexing protocols etc, not by the consensus protocol

## [1.4. Maths and Cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi5I2KcMPxo)

- Fully Homomorfic Encryption (FHE):
    - a form of encryption that allows arbitrary computation on encrypted data
    - an additional evaluation capability for computing over encrypted data without access to the secret key
    - the result of such encryption remains encrypted
    - extension of either symmetric-key or public-key cryptography
    - algebra example: considering `f(n) = e^n` homomorphism means `f(m + n) = e^(m + n) = e^m * e^n = f(m) * f(n)`
    - private computation: [fhEVM](https://www.zama.ai/fhevm) from [Zama.ai](https://www.zama.ai/)
- VRF explanation from [Algorand](https://medium.com/algorand/algorand-releases-first-open-source-code-of-verifiable-random-function-93c2960abd61)
- Modular aritmetic [introduction](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/what-is-modular-arithmetic):
    - multiples of B end up in the same spot: `A % B = (A + K*B) % B` for any integer K
    - A is congurent to B modulo C: `A == B mod C` (A and B are in the same equivalence class)
- Group theory:
    - set of elements and a binary operation (e.g. *)
    - must have these properties:
        - closure: for all a, b in G => a*b is also in G
        - associativity: (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)
        - identity element: a * e = e * a = a
        - inverse element: for each a in G there is a b (denoted as -a or a^-1) such that a * b = b * a = e
    - sub group: a set of elements which has the group properties is a subgroup of the original group
    - finite group: can be cyclic and has a generator
- Fields:
    - set of integers and 2 operations called addition and multiplication
    - field axioms:
        - associativity
        - commutativity
        - additive & multiplicative identity
        - additive & multiplicative inverses
        - distributivity of multiplication over addition: a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)
    - [finite fields](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/finite): a set of elements such as the set of integers mod p whare p is a prime
    - order of the field == the number of elements in the field's set. For a finite field it's either:
        - prime
        - power of prime (extension field)
    - every finite field has a generator which can generate the elements in the set be exponentiating the generator
        - Z(5) = {0,1,2,3,4} => it's cyclic and has two generators, 2 and 3:
            - 2^1 = 2, 2^2=4, 2^3=3, 2^4=1
            - 3^1 = 3, 3^2=4, 3^3=2, 3^4=1
- Group homomorphisms
    - A homomorphism is a map between two algebraic structures of the same type, tha tpreserves the operations of the structures: f(x*y) = f(x)*f(y)
- Equivalence classes
    - x mod 7 = 6 => x can be 6, 13, 20 and they form an equivalence class
    this give us the basis of a one way fn
- Fermat's little theorem is useful for finding a multiplicative inverse
    - a^-1 == a^p-2(modp)
